<h3>Project Proposal</h3>
<p><strong>1. Project Description</strong> <br />
My idea for this project is a web application that can be used to determine the best alcoholic drinks to drink for a given movie. The homepage for this application will provide a search bar where users can enter the name of a movie they want to watch and click a button and then they will be given a suggested category of drink and a specific drink from that category to pair with the movie. Potentially, this search could even return both a more affordable drink option and a best overall drink option for each search instead of just returning one drink. There could also be an option to enter the kind of drink you want to drink and then the system will return an appropriate movie to watch, but this would be an additional feature if there is enough time at the end of this course for it.</p>
<p>To get a system like this working properly there are a lot of other processes and pages that need to be constructed to make the program effective. First, there will need to be a way for users to create accounts. This will be fundamental to collecting personal and global data. Once that is set up, we will need to have users establish a baseline for how they rate movies. This will be similar to how Netflix initially identifies a user&rsquo;s taste by having them pick movies they like from a list of movies. They will pick some movies they have seen and rate them on a scale of 1 to 10. Their ratings will then be compared to ratings from a movie reviews site to see how they rate the movies compared to others to establish a personal critiquing baseline. </p>
<p>Using this baseline, the system will then need to have a way for users to enter movies they&rsquo;ve watched into our database. They will enter a movie, what they drank with it and how they&rsquo;d rate the movie. This will then be stored in the database and used to provide recommendations later on based on both personal and universal tastes. <br />
Furthermore, using the movie API and a drink-related API the system will be able to show the user some overall ratings for movies and drinks either after they enter a new entry into the database, or when they look up a movie or drink to find pairings.</p>

<p><strong>2. Project Design</strong><br />
To create this project I will need to use a handful of technologies. The overall architecture of the application will be created using Java and the Spring MVC framework. Then, I will first use the APIs of absolutdrinks and TheMovieDB to get ratings, genre/type and other information about drink and movies. These APIs use JSON, so I will need to be able to parse this using packages within Java/HTML/JS. I will also potentially need to use a tool like Bootstrap to create attractive and easily navigable web pages and database software like Google&rsquo;s Firebase. It is possible that as I work on this I will decide other technologies are better suited for my project, but for now these all seem like reasonable tools for my needs.<br />

  <p> <strong>3. Project Schedule </strong><br />
Checkpoint 1 - At the first checkpoint I will have lay a great groundwork for the project. At this point, I should have a project set up in Spring MVC fashion with empty webpages for every screen that it will need. At the time of writing this, this should be 2 main pages and then any other pages needed for creating accounts. By this checkpoint I should also have signed up for accounts and on both the API sites and experimented with the APIs in a sandbox environment. I should also have started working on the GUI for the main screen.<br />
Checkpoint 2 - By the time of the second checkpoint I should have a way for users to register and sign in and also have a search bar working that uses both APIs to some extent. The results don&rsquo;t have to be perfect or utilize the database yet, but should show some use of the APIs.<br />
Checkpoint 3 - The page to take user input on movie entries should be set up and a database should be created and then connected to it. <br />
Final Project - By the end of the project everything should be working as described in the proposal. There should be a way for users to register, login, add movie entries to the database and search for drink suggestions based on movie. If there is time, adding a feature to suggest movies based on drink would be a nice addition.</p>

  <p><strong>4. Project Justification </strong><br />
 This project is novel because it helps people come to decisions and try out new things potentially. Deciding what to drink or what to watch can be a very indecisive process for a lot of people. This application will not only provide suggestions for these people, but also hopefully transform their experience and give them something new to try. It is a simple tool that provides utility and fun to users without being much of a hassle to navigate.<br />
 This project will also provide me with a lot of useful experience. Working on a fullstack project will help me improve my web design skills, which is an extremely important and marketable field. I will also get a lot of experience working with APIs through this idea, thus allowing me to be able to manage external data much better in the future. Furthermore, I will need to work heavily with a database tool which will provide me with an even more technologically diverse experience. Overall, if I am able to meet all my goals I will learn an insane amount from doing this project.<br />
