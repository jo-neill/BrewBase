# BrewBase
This application takes user input on the home screen in the form of a movie name. If the movie named is spelled correctly and in the database on TheMovieDB.com it then finds the genre of the movie you entered and uses this to assign the movie a certain category of drinks. This category is then used to find a random drink of that type from TheCocktailDb's database of drinks. It then recommends pairing this drink with that movie and then shows a picture of the drink and provides a link where instructions for making the drink can be found. There is also another page users can navigate to where they can enter their own movie, drink and rating into a form which is then used to offer additional suggestions when a user goes to look up a drink on the main page.
